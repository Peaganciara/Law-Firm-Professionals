# Law-Firm-Professionals

There are approximately 460K law firms in the U.S. receiving multiple inquiries for possible cases each day. Legal intake professionals delegate these calls to alleviate the demand placed on lawyers and paralegals and sort inquiries into those of high priority. While servicing a multitude of law firms it is essential to represent each office in a professional manner while also displaying empathy. It is important to review intakes to determine areas of opportunity, learning and growth. 

This visualization will focus on the productivity of each agent employed at the call center. Points to focus on are amounts of contracts obtained per agent, type of contract obtained, and the relation of contracts obtained by agent per each law firm. The purpose of this project is to find areas where improvement can be implemented to better service the clients, as well as to applaud the agents that have exceeded expectations.
